S-Prolog
========

The beginnings of a Warren Abstract Machine based Prolog interpreter in Scala.  Currently, it does very little.  A first usable release will not appear for some time.

This will aim to be a subset of ISO Prolog including a standard Prolog parser using https://github.com/edadma/rtcep.
